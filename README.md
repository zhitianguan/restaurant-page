# Restaurant Page
This is a restaurant page made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tabs were used to display different pages, which are dynamically rendered. This was done as an assignment for The Odin Project curriculum.
You can check out the webpage here: https://zhitianguan.github.io/restaurant-page/

What I've Learned:
- ES6 Modules (importing and exporting statements)
- Installing packages with npm
- Bundling images, JS, and CSS files with webpack
- Add animations to website using animate.css library
